# ü¶æ PayProof ‚Äì Decentralized Invoice Generator with On-Chain Escrow

> Freelancers get paid *only* after client approval. Clients pay *only* after work is verified. PayProof builds trust using smart contracts, IPFS, and Web3 wallets.

---

## üîç Why PayProof?

Freelancing and remote work are booming. But trust is fragile.

* üéØ **Freelancers worry:** Will the client pay me after I deliver?
* ‚ùì **Clients worry:** What if the work is incomplete?

**PayProof solves this** using a decentralized smart contract escrow system with proof-of-payment and transparent workflows.
